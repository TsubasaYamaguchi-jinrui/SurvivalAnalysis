  abstract  = "Social scientists are interested in events and their causes.
               Although event histories are ideal for studying the causes of
               events, they typically possess two features---censoring and
               time-varying explanatory variables---that create major problems
               for standard statistical procedures. Several innovative
               approaches have been developed to accommodate these two
               peculiarities of event history data. This volume surveys these
               methods, concentrating on the approaches that are most useful to
               the social sciences. In particular, Paul D. Allison focuses on
               regression methods in which the occurrence of events is
               dependent on one or more explanatory variables. He gives
               attention to the statistical models that form the basis of event
               history analysis, and also to practical concerns such as data
               management, cost, and useful computer software. The Second
               Edition is part of SAGE's Quantitative Applications in the
               Social Sciences (QASS) series, which continues to serve
               countless students, instructors, and researchers in learning the
               most cutting-edge quantitative techniques.",

  abstract = "Longevity is a major component of variation in fitness in
              long-lived iteroparous species [1-4]. Among female baboons,
              variation in breeding lifespan accounts for approximately 50\% of
              the variation in lifetime fitness [5, 6]. However, we know little
              about the causes of variation in longevity in primates or other
              long-lived mammals. Savannah baboons form strong, equitable, and
              enduring relationships with specific female partners,
              particularly with close relatives and agemates [7-10]. The
              quality of females' social relationships influences their ability
              to cope with stressful events [11-13] and is associated with
              variation in female reproductive success [9, 14]. Here we show
              that dominance rank and the quality of close social bonds have
              independent effects on the longevity of female chacma baboons
              (Papio hamadryas ursinus). High-ranking females live longer than
              lower-ranking females. In addition, females who form stronger and
              more stable social bonds with other females live significantly
              longer than females who form weaker and less stable
              relationships. These data extend our understanding of the
              adaptive value of social bonds in baboons and complement a
              growing body of evidence that indicates that social bonds have
              adaptive value in a range of taxa, from mice to humans [9,
              14-19]. \copyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.",

  abstract = "Many species use social interactions to cope with challenges in
              their environment and a growing number of studies show that
              individuals which are well-connected to their group have higher
              fitness than socially isolated individuals. However, there are
              many ways to be 'well-connected' and it is unclear which aspects
              of sociality drive fitness benefits. Being well-connected can be
              conceptualized in four main ways: individuals can be socially
              integrated by engaging in a high rate of social behaviour or
              having many partners; they can have strong and stable connections
              to favoured partners; they can indirectly connect to the broader
              group structure; or directly engage in a high rate of beneficial
              behaviours, such as grooming. In this study, we use survival
              models and long-term data in adult female rhesus macaques (Macaca
              mulatta) to compare the fitness outcomes of multiple measures of
              social connectedness. Females that maintained strong connections
              to favoured partners had the highest relative survival
              probability, as did females well-integrated owing to forming many
              weak connections. We found no survival benefits to being
              structurally well-connected or engaging in high rates of
              grooming. Being well-connected to favoured partners could provide
              fitness benefits by, for example, increasing the efficacy of
              coordinated or mutualistic behaviours.",

  author   = "Thompson, Nicole A and Cords, Marina",
  abstract = "In group-living species, individuals often have preferred
              affiliative social partners, with whom ties or bonds can confer
              advantages that correspond with greater fitness. For example, in
              adult female baboons and juvenile horses, individuals with
              stronger or more social ties experience greater survival. We used
              detailed behavioral and life history records to explore the
              relationship between tie quality and survival in a gregarious
              monkey (Cercopithecus mitis stuhlmanni), while controlling for
              dominance rank, group size, and life history strategy. We used
              Cox proportional hazards regressions to model the cumulative
              (multi-year) and current (single-year) relationships of social
              ties and the hazard of mortality in 83 wild adult females of
              known age, observed 2--8 years each (437 subject-years) in eight
              social groups. The strength of bonds with close partners was
              associated with increased mortality risk under certain
              conditions: Females that had strong bonds with close partners
              that were inconsistent over multiple years had a higher risk of
              mortality than females adopting any other social strategy. Within
              a given year, females had a higher risk of death if they were
              strongly bonded with partners that changed from the previous year
              versus with partners that remained consistent. Dominance rank,
              number of adult female groupmates, and age at first reproduction
              did not predict the risk of death. This study demonstrates that
              costs and benefits of strong social bonds can be
              context-dependent, relating to the consistency of social partners
              over time.",

  abstract = "In humans and other animals, harsh circumstances in early life
              predict morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Multiple adverse
              conditions are thought to be especially toxic, but this
              hypothesis has rarely been tested in a prospective, longitudinal
              framework, especially in long-lived mammals. Here we use
              prospective data on 196 wild female baboons to show that
              cumulative early adversity predicts natural adult lifespan.
              Females who experience $\geq$3 sources of early adversity die a
              median of 10 years earlier than females who experience $\leq$1
              adverse circumstances (median lifespan is 18.5 years). Females
              who experience the most adversity are also socially isolated in
              adulthood, suggesting that social processes partially explain the
              link between early adversity and adult survival. Our results
              provide powerful evidence for the developmental origins of health
              and disease and indicate that close ties between early adversity
              and survival arise even in the absence of health habit and health

  abstract  = "Unlike most cercopithecines, hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas
               hamadryas) are characterized by female-biased dispersal. To
               clarify this pattern within the context of their hierarchical
               social system (comprising one-male units, clans, bands, and
               troops), we report here 7 years of data on female transfers
               among social units in wild hamadryas baboons in Ethiopia. Female
               tenure in one-male units (OMUs) ranged from 1 to 2,556 days (N =
               208) and survival analysis revealed a median tenure length of
               1,217 days (40 months). Changes in OMU membership consisted
               almost exclusively of takeovers by males, not voluntary
               transfer. Of 130 takeovers, 67\% occurred within the band and
               33\% across bands, and, of the 22 takeovers for which we have
               clan membership data, 77\% occurred within, not between, clans.
               These results reinforce the notion that hamadryas female
               dispersal is not analogous to sex-biased dispersal in other
               taxa, because (1) at least in Ethiopian populations, females do
               not disperse voluntarily but are transferred, often forcibly, by
               males; (2) only dispersal between bands will promote gene flow,
               whereas females are most often rearranged within bands; (3)
               hamadryas females undergo social dispersal but not usually
               locational dispersal; and (4) while male hamadryas are far more
               philopatric than females, they have been observed to disperse.
               It thus appears that the ancestral baboon pattern of female
               philopatry and male dispersal has evolved into a system in which
               neither sex is motivated to disperse, but females are forcibly
               transferred by males, leading to female-mediated gene flow, and
               males more rarely disperse to find females.",
