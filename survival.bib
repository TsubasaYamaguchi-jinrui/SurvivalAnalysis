  abstract  = "Social scientists are interested in events and their causes.
               Although event histories are ideal for studying the causes of
               events, they typically possess two features---censoring and
               time-varying explanatory variables---that create major problems
               for standard statistical procedures. Several innovative
               approaches have been developed to accommodate these two
               peculiarities of event history data. This volume surveys these
               methods, concentrating on the approaches that are most useful to
               the social sciences. In particular, Paul D. Allison focuses on
               regression methods in which the occurrence of events is
               dependent on one or more explanatory variables. He gives
               attention to the statistical models that form the basis of event
               history analysis, and also to practical concerns such as data
               management, cost, and useful computer software. The Second
               Edition is part of SAGE's Quantitative Applications in the
               Social Sciences (QASS) series, which continues to serve
               countless students, instructors, and researchers in learning the
               most cutting-edge quantitative techniques.",
