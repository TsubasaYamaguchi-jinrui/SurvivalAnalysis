               Analysis with R, Second Edition, presents an introduction to
               survival and event history analysis using real-life examples.
               Since publication of the first edition, focus in the field has
               gradually shifted towards the analysis of large and complex
               datasets. This has led to new ways of tabulating and analysing
               tabulated data with the same precision and power as that of an
               analysis of the full data set. Tabulation also makes it possible
               to share sensitive data with others without violating integrity.
               The new edition extends on the content of the first by both
               improving on already given methods and introducing new methods.
               There are two new chapters, Explanatory Variables and
               Regression, and Register- Based Survival Data Models. The book
               has been restructured to improve the flow, and there are
               significant updates to the computing in the supporting R
               package. Features • Introduction to survival and event history

  abstract  = "Social scientists are interested in events and their causes.
               Although event histories are ideal for studying the causes of
               events, they typically possess two features---censoring and
               time-varying explanatory variables---that create major problems
               for standard statistical procedures. Several innovative
               approaches have been developed to accommodate these two
               peculiarities of event history data. This volume surveys these
               methods, concentrating on the approaches that are most useful to
               the social sciences. In particular, Paul D. Allison focuses on
               regression methods in which the occurrence of events is
               dependent on one or more explanatory variables. He gives
               attention to the statistical models that form the basis of event
               history analysis, and also to practical concerns such as data
               management, cost, and useful computer software. The Second
               Edition is part of SAGE's Quantitative Applications in the

              long-lived iteroparous species [1-4]. Among female baboons,
              variation in breeding lifespan accounts for approximately 50\% of
              the variation in lifetime fitness [5, 6]. However, we know little
              about the causes of variation in longevity in primates or other
              long-lived mammals. Savannah baboons form strong, equitable, and
              enduring relationships with specific female partners,
              particularly with close relatives and agemates [7-10]. The
              quality of females' social relationships influences their ability
              to cope with stressful events [11-13] and is associated with
              variation in female reproductive success [9, 14]. Here we show
              that dominance rank and the quality of close social bonds have
              independent effects on the longevity of female chacma baboons
              (Papio hamadryas ursinus). High-ranking females live longer than
              lower-ranking females. In addition, females who form stronger and

              longer than females who form weaker and less stable
              relationships. These data extend our understanding of the
              adaptive value of social bonds in baboons and complement a
              growing body of evidence that indicates that social bonds have
              adaptive value in a range of taxa, from mice to humans [9,

              individuals which are well-connected to their group have higher

              many ways to be 'well-connected' and it is unclear which aspects
              of sociality drive fitness benefits. Being well-connected can be
              conceptualized in four main ways: individuals can be socially
              integrated by engaging in a high rate of social behaviour or
              having many partners; they can have strong and stable connections
              to favoured partners; they can indirectly connect to the broader

              behaviours, such as grooming. In this study, we use survival
              models and long-term data in adult female rhesus macaques (Macaca

              grooming. Being well-connected to favoured partners could provide

              adult female baboons and juvenile horses, individuals with
              stronger or more social ties experience greater survival. We used

              relationship between tie quality and survival in a gregarious
              monkey (Cercopithecus mitis stuhlmanni), while controlling for
              dominance rank, group size, and life history strategy. We used
              Cox proportional hazards regressions to model the cumulative
              (multi-year) and current (single-year) relationships of social
              ties and the hazard of mortality in 83 wild adult females of
              known age, observed 2--8 years each (437 subject-years) in eight
              social groups. The strength of bonds with close partners was
              associated with increased mortality risk under certain

              number of adult female groupmates, and age at first reproduction

  abstract  = "Unlike most cercopithecines, hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas
               hamadryas) are characterized by female-biased dispersal. To
               clarify this pattern within the context of their hierarchical
               social system (comprising one-male units, clans, bands, and
               troops), we report here 7 years of data on female transfers
               among social units in wild hamadryas baboons in Ethiopia. Female
               tenure in one-male units (OMUs) ranged from 1 to 2,556 days (N =
               208) and survival analysis revealed a median tenure length of
               1,217 days (40 months). Changes in OMU membership consisted
               almost exclusively of takeovers by males, not voluntary
               transfer. Of 130 takeovers, 67\% occurred within the band and
               33\% across bands, and, of the 22 takeovers for which we have
               clan membership data, 77\% occurred within, not between, clans.
               These results reinforce the notion that hamadryas female
               dispersal is not analogous to sex-biased dispersal in other
               taxa, because (1) at least in Ethiopian populations, females do
               not disperse voluntarily but are transferred, often forcibly, by
               males; (2) only dispersal between bands will promote gene flow,
               whereas females are most often rearranged within bands; (3)
               hamadryas females undergo social dispersal but not usually
               locational dispersal; and (4) while male hamadryas are far more
               philopatric than females, they have been observed to disperse.
               It thus appears that the ancestral baboon pattern of female
               philopatry and male dispersal has evolved into a system in which
               neither sex is motivated to disperse, but females are forcibly
               transferred by males, leading to female-mediated gene flow, and
               males more rarely disperse to find females.",
